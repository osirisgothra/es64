EarthSeige texture pack for Minetest

A 64x64 texture pack for minetest. A result of a lot of this red
baloon's hard work. You will just have to try it for youself to
see if you like it.

For Default Game AND Modded Servers or Modded Singleplayer!

    (here: comming soon, a list of the supported mods)

    For default game, it is complete.

    It also includes a LOT of the popular (and even some private server-side) mod textures too!
    Of the texture packs available, this one aims to be very complete.

    To date, approximately 653 hours have been spent in the various
    programs I use to devise these textures.

Programs Used To Produce This Pack:

    Gimp 2.8, 2.10      Photoshop CS6       Adobe Draw, Sketchbook
    Krita 4.3           Gwenview            LibreOffice Draw 2020
    Blender             TextureMaker EE     Genetica
    Materialist         Tilemolester        FreeTextures (website for royalty-free textures)
    Pixlr               Paint Tool SAI      Blender Compositor
    Maya 2009 LE        3DSMAX 2008 FE      vim/spaceVIM (code/text reading)

    perl 5.30.* [2]     ImageMagick [4]     GhostScript
    Lua 5.2.4 [3]       zsh 5.8-x64 [3]     Inkscape 

Operating Systems Used

 75%   Xubuntu (17.04, 19.10, 20.10, and currently 21.04)
 15%   Windows XP, 7, 10 (under virtualbox to run the windows based programs that wine cannot)
 10%   Wine Where Possible (Texturemaker and Photoshop, ran under this, but not 3DSMax, Genetica or Tilemolester)
    
Window Managers

 i3             (primary window manager for 90% of the time, most reliable)
 gxdwm          (my own fork of dwm, used for some stuff i3 cant do)
 enlightenment  e-23 (0.23.1) (my preferred window manager, when i have the resources)

Machine

 A very slow machine, just an old Intel Core2 Duo 3.1Ghz, Two threads even though it says core2
 the idea of cores and threads back then didnt mean the same thing apparently.

 RAM: 4GB (1GB dedicated to the VC)
 Video: NVIDIA GeForce GT 610/PCIe/SSE (all lanes with external power connector)
 Sound: Sound Blaster Audigy ZS2-PE Gold-Plated Version with Live!Drive (10-channel surround), optical
        Onboard (standard sucky pretend ac3 audio thing)
 HDD:   (worst part) 40GB WDC Drive, and not a very fast one
        have to use 4 usb sticks just to do this texture pack
        half my programs run off of USB sticks, im poor

 Why post the specs anyway? To show exactly what was used to create the texture pack, in case anyone
 wanted to know. Saves me answering questions later.

The pack has changed A LOT, so I will make new shots ASAP.
This pack is geared toward Blocky Survival and Tunneler's Abyss, if you have a server
you'd like me to test on, shoot me a message on github or on the Tunneler's Abyss Discord.
