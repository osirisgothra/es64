EarthSeige texture pack for Minetest

A 64x64 texture pack for minetest. A result of a lot of this red
baloon's hard work. You will just have to try it for youself to
see if you like it.

For Default Game AND Modded Servers or Modded Singleplayer!

    (here: comming soon, a list of the supported mods)

    For default game, it is complete.

    It also includes a LOT of the popular (and even some private server-side) mod textures too!
    Of the texture packs available, this one aims to be very complete.

    To date, approximately 653 hours have been spent in the various
    programs I use to devise these textures.

Important Notes for the Future:

    The overrides.txt has all it's comment footnotes in a file called 'overrides.txt.comments'
    to keep it neat and tidy. This file will be moving into the 'extras' subdirectory by the
    Fall of 2021. 

    Due to github's semi-annoying directory truncation, I may have to split things (back) up into
    directories but I havent done this because minetest loads the texture pack MUCH slower when
    it is split up like that (It can take up to an extra 3-5 minutes on some machines!). I havent
    decided on a workaround for this but a few are listed here:

        Installer (not desirable, just another annoying step for the user)
        Archive textures (again, another annoying step for the user, plus cant see it on github)
        Split into Dirs by mod (tried this, slows things way down)
        Move things into dirs by file count (kinda cumbersome)
        Move things into dirs by name (slow AND cumbersome)
        Link to an online installer (security and cross-platform issues here)

        Any ideas are welcome. The last entry might be employed just as an added convienence 
        in addition to another measure, at this time, you will have to clone or download the
        repository to see all the files in it. I am going to also try adding a list of supported
        mods as soon as I get around to it (as I note later in this and other documentation).

Operating Systems Used

 75%   Xubuntu (17.04, 19.10, 20.10, and currently 21.04)
 15%   Windows XP, 7, 10 (under virtualbox to run the windows based programs that wine cannot)
 10%   Wine Where Possible (Texturemaker and Photoshop, ran under this, but not 3DSMax, Genetica or Tilemolester)
    
Window Managers

 i3             (primary window manager for 90% of the time, most reliable)
 gxdwm          (my own fork of dwm, used for some stuff i3 cant do)
 enlightenment  e-23 (0.23.1) (my preferred window manager, when i have the resources)

Machine

 A very slow machine, just an old Intel Core2 Duo 3.1Ghz, Two threads even though it says core2
 the idea of cores and threads back then didnt mean the same thing apparently.

 RAM: 4GB (1GB dedicated to the VC)
 Video: NVIDIA GeForce GT 610/PCIe/SSE (all lanes with external power connector)
 Sound: Sound Blaster Audigy ZS2-PE Gold-Plated Version with Live!Drive (10-channel surround), optical
        Onboard (standard sucky pretend ac3 audio thing)
 HDD:   (worst part) 40GB WDC Drive, and not a very fast one
        have to use 4 usb sticks just to do this texture pack
        half my programs run off of USB sticks, im poor

 Why post the specs anyway? To show exactly what was used to create the texture pack, in case anyone
 wanted to know. Saves me answering questions later.

The pack has changed A LOT, so I will make new shots ASAP.
This pack is geared toward Blocky Survival and Tunneler's Abyss, if you have a server
you'd like me to test on, shoot me a message on github or on the Tunneler's Abyss Discord.
