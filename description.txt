EarthSeige texture pack for Minetest

A Beautiful Texture Pack that brings some of the most popular
minetest modpacks to life, many of the textures were hand created
by myself (there is a list on the wiki). And during updates you
can see exactly what changed by checking my commit log.

EarthSeige is a 64x texture pack but includes a script to help users
downsample (still beta) the images to a smaller size if their machines
cannot handle the memory needed. It also can be used to upsample using
the popular 2xsai filtering, which is what I used to transform many
of the original textures.

Many more of the textures were either converted from web resources and textures
featuring some of the best texturepack styles out there inspired by:

Pixel Perfection
Soartex
HDX
And More (Not listed, contact me!)

This pack will never cost money or anything else, if you paid time, money, services
or otherwise, this was done illegally and you need to report the outlet in which
you found these files. They will always be free and available to all on github.
