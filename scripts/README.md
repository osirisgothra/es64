About This Directory
====================

Do not use these scripts without first seeing what they do, this means
opening them, looking at the source. Some of these are works in progress
while others may be defunct. I guarentee nothing -- they might even cause
damage to your system in their current state so DONT USE THEM UNLESS YOU
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. And remember NOTHING IN HERE IS 
CONSIDERED WORKING nor intended for the end user (read on 'End-Users').

As far as the files themselves go, from now on, all scripts (any language) 
will be kept here, no scripts are going to be allowed in the main directory.


End-Users
=========

End-Users may safely delete this (and any other) directory, only the root directory is needed for the pack to operate.


Files
=====

This is in no way a complete description, but a summary of the last know files
in this directory:

defunct = Not working or not finished, or, now broken because they no longer serve
          any purpose

These files are kept only to serve as a base for future script needs
and usually become defunct once their purposes are served. Text 'sources'
can be found in the ../logs directory.          


Contributers
============

Do not delete  directories if you plan to contribute to the project, your pull request would be denied.
If you accidently remove items, you must roll back (backup your changed files) and restore said items in order
to submit pull requests. You can contribute indirectly via email, github posts that have properly named
attachments. Such methods are subject to a longer wait--they will not be reviewed as often as pull requests.

License, etc
============

See the ../README.md for full details.
