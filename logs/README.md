End-Users
=========

End-Users may safely delete this (and any other) directory, only the root directory is needed for the pack to operate.


Contributers
============

Do not delete  directories if you plan to contribute to the project, your pull request would be denied.
If you accidently remove items, you must roll back (backup your changed files) and restore said items in order
to submit pull requests. You can contribute indirectly via email, github posts that have properly named
attachments. Such methods are subject to a longer wait--they will not be reviewed as often as pull requests.

License, etc
============

See the ../README.md for full details.
